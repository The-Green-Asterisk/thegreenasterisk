        <p>Welcome to the repository of worlds I have created as campaign settings for any Table Top RPG of your choice, but mostly D&D 5e. Here you can read up on characters, places, organizations, items, and whatever else you need to keep track of as either a player or GM of these games. Click on one of the world tabs above to get started.</p>
