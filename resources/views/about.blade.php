    <h1>Hi! My name is Steve.</h1>
    <p>Whether you meant to or not, you've found the Green Asterisk. I call it that because, in coding, an Asterisk is a
        wildcard that stands in for any and all terms or characters within given parameters, and in writing it's a
        notation to look in the margins for an explanation of what you just read. Basically, it can mean anything and
        everything, so it can fit whatever journey I find myself on in any given moment.</p>
    <p>Right now my journey is, in part, that of a web developer and what you see before you is one of the
        fruits of my labor. Everything on this website was hand-crafted by me using Laravel and TypeScript.
        Well, except for those text editor boxes; those were made by <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/">Tiny MCE</a>. Oh,
        and I guess I should also mention some of the pictures you see here were created by <a
            href="https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a>.</p>
    <p> My other special interest is tabletop gaming. I run three games a week and the <a
            href="{{ route('many-worlds.index') }}">Many Worlds</a> section of this site is where I'm supposed to be
        keeping a repository of the important information of my homebrew campaigns. (I need to keep up with that
        better...) Anyway, welcome!</p>
