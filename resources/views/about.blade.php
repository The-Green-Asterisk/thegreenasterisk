    <h1>Hi! My name is Steve.</h1>
    <p>Whether you meant to or not, you've found my little corner of the internet, the Green Asterisk. I call it that
        because, in coding, an Asterisk generally means to grab everything within the specified directory, and in
        writing it's a notation to look somewhere else for an explanation of what you just read. Basically, it can mean
        whatever you want it to mean and it can fit whatever journey I find myself on in the moment.</p>
    <p>For example, I used to be a social media manager. That was a good chunk of my life, and it was fun, but recently
        it was time to move on. I decided to become a web developer instead and what you see before you is one of the
        fruits of my labor. Everything on this website was hand-crafted by me using Laravel and vanilla Javascript.
        Well, except for text editor boxes, those were made by <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/">Tiny MCE</a>. If I was
        going to code all that it would have taken a lot longer and forced me to keep the website closed for longer than
        I wanted to. So enjoy Tiny's work, too. Oh, I guess I should also mention some of the pictures you see here were
        created by <a href="https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a>.</p>
    <p> Take a look around! If you like what you see, let me know. Follow me on the socials and if this website looks
        like something you need for yourself, get in touch and maybe I can help you out with that!</p>
    <h3>Safe journeys, friend!</h3>
